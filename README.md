Metalloporphyrin-based colorimetric gas sensors detect odors via reversible color changes from ligand coordination with volatile organic compounds (VOCs).​

Materials Needed
Metalloporphyrins: Cobalt(II) tetraphenylporphyrin (CoTPP), zinc tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP), manganese(III) tetraphenylporphyrin chloride (MnTPPCl) – 1-5 mg each.

pH indicators: Bromocresol green, dimethyl yellow (5 mg each).

Substrate: Whatman #1 filter paper or silica gel TLC plates (cut to 2x2 cm squares).

Solvent: Dichloromethane (DCM) or chloroform (10 mL).

Optional: Nanoporous silica particles for enhanced porosity.​

Preparation Steps
Dissolve 1 mg of each metalloporphyrin and indicator in 1 mL DCM to make 0.1-1 mM stock solutions.

Spot 1-2 μL of each solution in an array pattern (6x6 grid) on filter paper using a micropipette; dry under fume hood for 5-10 min.​

Alternatively, dip-coat paper in mixed solution (1:1:1 ratio dyes), dry, then cut into sensor strips.​

Bake at 60°C for 30 min to fix dyes; store in desiccator.​

Testing Protocol
Expose array to odor headspace (e.g., butyric acid vial) for 1-5 min in sealed chamber; capture before/after images with smartphone under consistent lighting. Analyze ΔRGB values using ImageJ or Python OpenCV for pattern recognition – CoTPP turns red-to-green for amines, MnTPP shifts blue for acids.​
